**Responsive Web Design | Layout Techniques | Working with Media**  

In this assignment we build a multi page responsive website. It will require flex, grid and column layouts.  The pages and assets are included in this repo.  There are `TODO`s in each page that provide pointers to what needs to be done in order to complete the HTML in the page.  There is also an empty style sheet `css/style.css` that we'll work on.
